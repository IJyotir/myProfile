## **The Infinite Game - Simon Sinek**

Not only for business people, but for everyone. This book opened more my mind to the meaning of life. Everyone with a spark of good inside could get inspired and think onwards what choices they make for improving their life and especially the lives of others in the long term. This book would teach me patience in life working for a better tomorrow.  What I've thought before, it's actually here too: that better is better than the best. The process in getting better and sticking to our Just Cause might be long (actually being infinite) and not pleasant at all times but it's more worth it than to look only for the short-term material success.

## **Outliers - Malcolm Gladwell**

In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers" - the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.

Brilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.

## **The Rosie Result - Graeme Simsion**

Fantastically moving and funny.
The listen had felt like an empathy exercise. The characters created by the brilliant Grame Simson are lovely and unique. They solve loads of problems (technical and interpersonal) and take care of one another in the quirkiest and most lovable ways.

## **Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman**

There have been many good books on human rationality and irrationality, but only one masterpiece. That masterpiece is Daniel Kahneman's  _Thinking, Fast and Slow._  Kahneman, a winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, distils a lifetime of research into an encyclopedic coverage of both the surprising miracles and the equally surprising mistakes of our conscious and unconscious thinking. He achieves an even greater miracle by weaving his insights into an engaging narrative that is compulsively readable from beginning to end. 

## **Inglorious Empire - Shashi Tharoor**

There's an African proverb that goes: "Until lions tell their own stories, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter."      It took a while, but India finally has her lion in Dr. Tharoor. With fangs of unassailable logic and claws of incontrovertible proof, he eviscerates the British claim that colonialism was a good thing for India.      Tharoor's masterstroke is relying primary on the written testimonies of Britain's own citizens—whether that of officers callously describing their own atrocities, or that of the few conscience-stricken Britishers horrified at incredible tyranny and racism they were witnessing. 


## **Unlimted Memory - Kevin Horsley**

This book delivers completely new and refreshing ideas on how to create value in the world." (Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook)  
"When a risk taker writes a book, read it. In the case of Peter Thiel, read it twice. Or, to be safe, three times. This is a classic." (Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of _The Black Swan_)

## **Superintelligence -Nick Bostrom**

**It’s a grind**

I wasn’t sure how to rate this title, as the actual information found here is the most complete source on the subject matter. However, it is seriously tough to get through. The narrators tone is dull and rather monotone, which is doubly unfortunate as it almost feels like he is reading one long, book sized list of highly technical jargon, specifically designed to lose lamen like myself. This seems like a title it would be better to have a hard copy of, in order to study from, as the combination of the authors writing style and the narrators performance does not make for easy listening.

## **Why I stopped Wearing my Socks - Alok Kejriwal**

By the time he was 20, Alok Kejriwal had his life preplanned for him. He would inherit the family’s socks manufacturing business and be the hardworking, money minting, quintessential Marwari businessman - forever.

Except that it didn’t turn out that way. A few years after surviving the family setup, something turned up that sent Alok on a completely different career path: the INTERNET!

A crazy business idea Alok had turned out to be a winner, and contests2win.com was born. Soon, Alok was fighting and thriving in a world completely different from the one he had grown up in. A world where technology breakthroughs, VCs, and out-of-the-box thinking decided the real winners.

_Why I Stopped Wearing My Socks_  is Alok’s real life story of starting up and unadulterated entrepreneurship. It traces his roller-coaster ride as an aspiring entrepreneur, traversing through a variety of business ideas in the family business up to his big breakthrough as one of India’s first entrepreneurs to tap the power of the internet. It details the amazing success of contests2win.com and Mobile2win, a venture eventually acquired by The Walt Disney Company. The chapters in the book are actual stories, throbbing with memorable anecdotes that conclude with crisp learnings for the listeners.

_Why I Stopped Wearing My Socks_  is a deeply compelling story about beating the odds, staying motivated and gung-ho entrepreneurship. It is an inspiration as well as a practical guide to emerging a winner.

## **Never Split the Difference - Chirs Voss, Tahl Raz**

A former FBI hostage negotiator offers a new, field-tested approach to negotiating - effective in any situation.

After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri, Chris Voss joined the FBI, where his career as a kidnapping negotiator brought him face-to-face with bank robbers, gang leaders and terrorists.  _Never Split the Difference_  takes you inside his world of high-stakes negotiations, revealing the nine key principles that helped Voss and his colleagues succeed when it mattered the most - when people’s lives were at stake.

Rooted in the real-life experiences of an intelligence professional at the top of his game,  _Never Split the Difference_  will give you the competitive edge in any discussion.

## **Permanent Record -Edward Snowden**

Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government’s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.

In 2013, 29-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.

Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood,  _Permanent Record_  is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online – a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet’s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor,  _Permanent Record_  is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.

## **Liar's Poker - Michael Lewis**

It was wonderful to be young and working on Wall Street in the 1980s - never had so many 24-year-olds made so much money in so little time.

In this shrewd and wickedly funny audiobook, Michael Lewis describes an astonishing era and his own rake's progress through a powerful investment bank. From an unlikely beginning (art history at Princeton?) he rose in two short years from Salomon Brothers trainee to Geek (the lowest form of life on the trading floor) to Big Swinging Dick: a bond salesman who could turn over millions of dollars' worth of doubtful bonds with just one call.

A born storyteller, Michael Lewis shows us how things really worked on Wall Street. The bond traders, wearing greed and ambition as badges of honor, might well have swaggered straight from the pages of  _Bonfire of the Vanities_. But for all their outrageous behavior, they were in fact presiding over enormous changes in the world economy. Lewis' job was to transfer money, in the form of bonds, from those outside America who saved to those inside America who consumed. In doing so, he generated tens of millions of dollars for Salomon Brothers and earned for himself a ringside seat on the greatest financial spectacle of the decade: the leveraging of America.

## **The One Thing - Garry Keller, Jay Papasan**

## **Atomic Habits - James Clear**

A revolutionary system to get 1 percent better every day.

People think when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions - doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early or holding a single short phone call.

He calls them atomic habits.

In this groundbreaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone) and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated and happy.

These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships and your life.
