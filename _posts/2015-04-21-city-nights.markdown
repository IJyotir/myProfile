## **Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman**

> "There have been many good books on human rationality and irrationality, but only one masterpiece. That masterpiece is Daniel Kahneman's  _Thinking, Fast and Slow._  Kahneman, a winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, distils a lifetime of research into an encyclopedic coverage of both the surprising miracles and the equally surprising mistakes of our conscious and unconscious thinking. He achieves an even greater miracle by weaving his insights into an engaging narrative that is compulsively readable from beginning to end. 

## **Inglorious Empire - Shashi Tharoor**

> There's an African proverb that goes: "Until lions tell their own
> stories, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter."      It
> took a while, but India finally has her lion in Dr. Tharoor. With
> fangs of unassailable logic and claws of incontrovertible proof, he
> eviscerates the British claim that colonialism was a good thing for
> India.      Tharoor's masterstroke is relying primary on the written
> testimonies of Britain's own citizens—whether that of officers
> callously describing their own atrocities, or that of the few
> conscience-stricken Britishers horrified at incredible tyranny and
> racism they were witnessing. 


## **Unlimted Memory - Kevin Horsley**

  "This book delivers completely new and refreshing ideas on how to create value in the world." (Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook)  
"When a risk taker writes a book, read it. In the case of Peter Thiel, read it twice. Or, to be safe, three times. This is a classic." (Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of _The Black Swan_)

## **Superintelligence -Nick Bostrom**

**It’s a grind**

I wasn’t sure how to rate this title, as the actual information found here is the most complete source on the subject matter. However, it is seriously tough to get through. The narrators tone is dull and rather monotone, which is doubly unfortunate as it almost feels like he is reading one long, book sized list of highly technical jargon, specifically designed to lose lamen like myself. This seems like a title it would be better to have a hard copy of, in order to study from, as the combination of the authors writing style and the narrators performance does not make for easy listening.

## **Why I stopped Wearing my Socks - Alok Kejriwal**

> By the time he was 20, Alok Kejriwal had his life preplanned for him.
> He would inherit the family’s socks manufacturing business and be the
> hardworking, money minting, quintessential Marwari businessman -
> forever.
> 
> Except that it didn’t turn out that way. A few years after surviving
> the family setup, something turned up that sent Alok on a completely
> different career path: the INTERNET!
> 
> A crazy business idea Alok had turned out to be a winner, and
> contests2win.com was born. Soon, Alok was fighting and thriving in a
> world completely different from the one he had grown up in. A world
> where technology breakthroughs, VCs, and out-of-the-box thinking
> decided the real winners.
> 
> _Why I Stopped Wearing My Socks_  is Alok’s real life story of starting up and unadulterated entrepreneurship. It traces his
> roller-coaster ride as an aspiring entrepreneur, traversing through a
> variety of business ideas in the family business up to his big
> breakthrough as one of India’s first entrepreneurs to tap the power of
> the internet. It details the amazing success of contests2win.com and

> is an inspiration as well as a practical guide to emerging a winner.

## **Never Split the Difference - Chirs Voss, Tahl Raz**

> A former FBI hostage negotiator offers a new, field-tested approach to
> negotiating - effective in any situation.
