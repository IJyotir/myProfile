 - **Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman**

> "There have been many good books on human rationality and irrationality, but only one masterpiece. That masterpiece is Daniel Kahneman's  _Thinking, Fast and Slow._  Kahneman, a winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, distils a lifetime of research into an encyclopedic coverage of both the surprising miracles and the equally surprising mistakes of our conscious and unconscious thinking. He achieves an even greater miracle by weaving his insights into an engaging narrative that is compulsively readable from beginning to end.

> "Absorbing, intriguing...By making us aware of our minds' tricks, Kahneman hopes to inspire individuals and organisations to identify strategies to outwit them" (Jenni Russell,  _Sunday Times_)
> 
> "Profound ... As Copernicus removed the Earth from the centre of the universe and Darwin knocked humans off their biological perch, Mr. Kahneman has shown that we are not the paragons of reason we assume ourselves to be." (  _The Economist_)


**Inglorious Empire - Shashi Tharoor**

> There's an African proverb that goes: "Until lions tell their own
> stories, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter."      It
> took a while, but India finally has her lion in Dr. Tharoor. With
> fangs of unassailable logic and claws of incontrovertible proof, he
> eviscerates the British claim that colonialism was a good thing for
> India.      Tharoor's masterstroke is relying primary on the written
> testimonies of Britain's own citizens—whether that of officers
> callously describing their own atrocities, or that of the few
> conscience-stricken Britishers horrified at incredible tyranny and
> racism they were witnessing. The accounts of Indian and American
> observers are there too, whenever needed.      Everything good that
> modern British revisionists claim that India owes to the Raj—railways,
> banking, press and even democracy—is shown to be introduced
> exclusively to serve British interests. Indians were denied even the
> smallest modicum of gain through these ostensibly progressive measures
> (the only arguable exception being the press, though that too wasn't
> as rosy as revisionists would have you believe). On the contrary,
> these measures were used as tools to compound their exploitation.     
> Not to mention the bad stuff India owes to the Raj—plunder of
> resources, systematic dismantling of Indian industries, cultural
> destruction and the introduction of communal divide, to mention a few.
> Many western reviewers have hailed Tharoor's exposure of the colonial
> project's "long and shameless record of rapacity" as being a
> much-needed reality-check in a time where more than half of Britain
> (according to a 2014 poll) is living under the delusion that the
> British Empire was a good thing and are yearning for it: a phenomenon
> termed "post-colonial melancholia". Various publications highlighted
> the need to teach "unromanticized colonial history" in British
> schools.      What baffles me is the response of some Indian
> reviewers, who have somehow found the failings of the modern Indian
> government worthy of being compared to the avaricious exploits of the
> Raj. For instance, yes, India still has famines. But unlike the
> colonial government, Indian government is not creating famines by
> actively taking away food produced by farmers and selling it abroad.
> Neither have they outlawed philanthropic attempts to donate funds to
> the needy, again unlike the colonial government. Anybody who, after
> reading the book, still believes the two are comparable, is either
> being willingly dense or trying to push a political agenda. It's bad
> enough that the history taught in Indian schools severely undermines
> the magnitude of racism, hate, intolerance and cruelty meted out to
> the average Indian during the Raj. We don't need historians who set
> the record straight being attacked by petty Anglophiles or
> pseudo-intellectual contrarians.      One last thing. The reason I
> took away one star from the overall rating is not that anything is
> wrong with this audiobook. After all, Tharoor's boundless vocabulary
> and perfect diction could give the Queen of England a run for her
> money. It's because I believe this book should be re-read and
> memorized by every nationalist worth his salt; and while the audiobook
> is a worthy companion piece for this purpose, the hardback would be
> the better way to consume it.      Speaking of consumption, Bacon once
> wrote that "some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and
> some few to be chewed and digested." Well, you need to masticate the
> chapters of this book and chymify them until these facts are
> assimilated in the very blood of your veins. Jai Hind.
